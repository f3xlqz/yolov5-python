# Fruit Detection with YOLOv5 using Webcam

## Overview
This project is designed to detect fruits using the YOLOv5 object detection model and a webcam. By utilizing Python and the YOLOv5 model, the program captures video frames from the webcam, processes them, and identifies fruits in real-time. This project can be extended to detect various types of fruits and can be used as a base for applications in agriculture, inventory systems, or interactive educational tools.

### Key Features:
- Real-time fruit detection using YOLOv5
- Webcam integration for live video feed
- Simple and easy-to-understand code
